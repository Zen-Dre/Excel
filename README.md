# Excel Projects

About: For this project I'll be exploring the Jitters Coffee Shop dataset. I'll clean, analyze, and create a dashboard in-order to illustrate metrics thats accurately convey the business past performance. 

Tools: Excel

* Business Problem: The manager at Jitters Coffee Shop needs a perfomance report and hired you for the purpose of providing a visual representation of the business performance.

* Analysis Process: First I'll check the dataset for duplicates and or missing values. Then I'll proceed by creating fields that measure; sales over time, sales by country and
  the top 5 customers in terms of sales. The functions I'll use in this project are; XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, IF, SUM, AVG, CONCAT, DATE, and TEXT.
